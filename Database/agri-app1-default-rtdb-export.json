The black rot fungus overwinters in canes, tendrils, and leaves on the grape vine and on the ground. Mummified berries on the ground or those that are still clinging to the vines become the major infection source the following spring.\n\n        <br/> 2. During rain, microscopic spores (ascospores) are shot out of numerous, black fruiting bodies (perithecia) and are carried by air currents to young, expanding leaves. In the presence of moisture, these spores germinate in 36 to 48 hours and eventually penetrate the leaves and fruit stems. \n\n        <br/> 3. The infection becomes visible after 8 to 25 days. When the weather is wet, spores can be released the entire spring and summer providing continuous infection.\n\n\n        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>\n        <br/>1. Space vines properly and choose a planting site where the vines will be exposed to full sun and good air circulation. Keep the vines off the ground and insure they are properly tied, limiting the amount of time the vines remain wet thus reducing infection.\n\n        <br/>2.

Pesticides registered to protect the developing new growth include copper, captan, ferbam, mancozeb, maneb, triadimefon, and ziram. Important spraying times are as new shoots are 2 to 4 inches long, and again when they are 10 to 15 inches long, just before bloom, just after bloom, and when the fruit has set."

It spends a portion of its two-year life cycle on Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana). The pathogen’s spores develop in late fall on the juniper as a reddish brown gall on young branches of the trees.\n\n        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>\n        <br/>1. Since the juniper galls are the source of the spores that infect the apple trees, cutting them is a sound strategy if there aren’t too many of them.\n\n        <br/>2. While the spores can travel for miles, most of the ones that could infect your tree are within a few hundred feet.\n        \n        <br/>3. The best way to do this is to prune the branches about 4-6 inches below the galls."
